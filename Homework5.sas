Exercise 1: Estimating the Proportion of Blue Plain M&M’s®
[Please do not eat the lab materials until the exercise has concluded!] An article in The Austin American-Statesman 1(AAS) reported that 20% of the candies in bags of plain M&M’s® were blue. This 20% should be considered a characteristic of the M&M® population. Consider a blue M&M® a “success”, and a failure to be a non-blue M&M®.
  Carefully count the total number of M&M’s® in your bags. Re-check your count.
  Carefully count the number of BLUE M&M® in your bags. Re-check your counts.
  Instructions will be given in class about recording this information.
  After the last lab, we will send out the aggregate counts (over all lab sections) that you can use to complete the homework.

Answer questions 1-6, using the aggregate totals (which will be provided after the last lab).
  1. What is the random variable of interest?
    A. The number of candies observed
    B. The number of non-blue M&Ms observed
    C. The number of blue M&Ms observed
    D. The mean number of candies
  2. What are the characteristics of your random variable?
    A. Two outcomes, independent and random number of trials
    B. Two outcomes, dependent and fixed number of trials
    C. Two outcomes, independent and fixed number of trials
    D. Three outcomes, independent and fixed number of trials
3. If it is true that the manufacturer aims for 20% of each bag to contain blue candies, how many blue M&M’s® would you expect, given the aggregate count (i.e. the total from the 4 labs)? (Round to the nearest whole number)

4. Use SAS to calculate the exact binomial probability of observing  the aggregate # of blue M&M’s® if the true probability of a blue candy = 0.2. (Round to 3 decimal places)

5. An alternate source from 2010 (purportedly a letter from the manufacturer2) stated that M&M'S have this distribution: 24% blue, 20% orange, 16% green, 14% yellow, 13% red, 13% brown. If 0.24 is the true population proportion of blues, what is the probability of observing  the aggregate # of blue M&M’s® we observed? (Enter your answer in scientific notation, if necessary).

6. Given your answers above, which population proportion of blue candies is more likely to be correct?
    A. 20%
    B. 24%
    C. Can’t tell.
    
Exercise 2: 
7. Make a bar chart showing the distribution of M&M® colors in 2004. Use the data in
S:\course\BIOS500\WEISS\DATASETS\m_and_m_colors2004.sas7bdat. Add 1-3 lines of text describing your results
and submit your plot on question 7 of the online assessment.
