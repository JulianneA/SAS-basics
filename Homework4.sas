*Question 11;
*Create a new variable, contact_total, that sums the contact_home and contact_work variables from the exposure dataset;
*What is the mean of contact_total? (report to nearest tenth);

*Question 12;
*Using If/Then statements, create a categorical variable from BMI in the exposure dataset, using the following categories;
    *Underweight: less than 18.5;
    *Normal: >=18.5, less than 25;
    *Overweight: >=25, but less than 30;
    *Obese: 30 or higher;
*How many subjects in the dataset are classified as “normal weight”?;

*Question 13;
*What percentage of subjects are classified as “obese”? (Report to nearest tenth);

*Question 14;
*Create a format for the binary coding scheme 1=YES, 0=NO. Apply the format to two of the;
*variables in your exposure dataset that use this coding scheme (e.g. respiratory and smoke); 
*and run a PROC FREQ with these two variables. Print the output table (it should show the;
*formats) with your name as the title.  Copy the outputted table into a Word document;

*Question 15;
*In the same Word document from #14 above, copy your SAS code used to answer question 11-14;
*Make sure there is a comment heading containing you name.  Your SAS code is expected to be well;
*-commented and formatted for easy reading.  Your attached file should include both the output table and your code;
*Submit your document as “LASTNAME_FIRST_NAME_BIOS500L_LAB4HW.doc”;
